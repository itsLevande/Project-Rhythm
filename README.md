# Project Rhythm
A work-in-progress tool for the creation of Project Rhythm Stages.

# About
Project Rhythm is an upcoming rhythm game that will take place in a fully customizable 3d environtment. 

At this current point in time, this tool only allows for the editing of only a few aspects of the file format. With time, I will add more and more features to the project, while also refining various aspects of the user interface. 

Please feel free to report any issues that you may come upon. If you have any suggestions for gameplay elements / design changes, please let me know!
